This repository contains examples that show the usage of the [Synchronous Data Streaming (SDS) Framework](https://github.com/ARM-software/SDS-Framework).

**[Watch this video](https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/videos/KeilStudio/DevOps_With_Keil_MDK_Webinar.mp4#t=11:27 "SDS-Framework: Workbench for AI model and DSP development")** and explore the projects below.

<br clear="left"/>

## Quick Start

1. Install [Keil Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and [Arm SDS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.cmsis-sds) from the
   VS Code marketplace.
2. Clone this Git repository into a VS Code workspace.
3. Open the [CMSIS View](https://mdk-packs.github.io/vscode-cmsis-solution-docs/userinterface.html#2-main-area-of-the-cmsis-view)
   in VS Code and use the ... menu to choose an example via *Select Active Solution from workspace*.
4. The related tools and software packs are downloaded and installed. Review progress with *View - Output - CMSIS Solution*.
5. In the CMSIS view, use the
   [Action buttons](https://github.com/ARM-software/vscode-cmsis-csolution?tab=readme-ov-file#action-buttons) to build,
   load and debug the example on target hardware.
6. Follow the instructions in the example README and use the SDS view to show, record, and playback data streams.

## Example Description

The SDS examples are configured for various Evaluation Boards and use the [MDK-Middleware](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/mdk-middleware-keil/overview/) for the [SDSIO Interface](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/sdsio.html). New hardware targets can be added using board layers that provide the required API interfaces.
The examples are configured for [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://www.keil.arm.com/).
Run a Blinky example for the related board first to verify tool installation.

-->

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The repository uses [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows) to test project build with AC6 and execute algorithm tests.
Refer to [Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions) and [Arm FVPs](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/infrastructure/html/avh_gh_actions.html) documentation for more information.
